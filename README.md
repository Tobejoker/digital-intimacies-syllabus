## Project

The project originated from an independent study titled "Feminism, Social Media, Digital Cultures" with [Dr. Anastasia Todd](https://www.anastasiatoddphd.com/) in Fall 2024. Our reading list was primarily based on the [TikTok Syllabus](https://tiktokcultures.com/syllabus2021/) by Crystal Abidin and D. Bondy Valdovinos Kaye. Additionally, I explored literature recommended by Anastasia, including Amy Shields Dobson, Brady Robards, and Nicholas Carah's (2018) edited volume [*Digital Intimate Publics and Social Media*](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-97607-5). Inspired by their critical approach to emergent intimate practices on social media platforms, I developed a 15-week "Digital Intimacies" syllabus for a graduate seminar, with an emphasis on Gender and Women's Studies. This draft evolved into a public site to share my growing scholarly repository on "digital intimacies" and to gather feedback from researchers worldwide.
