!!! Info
    Below is the to-do list for later versions of Digital Intimacies Syllabus.

## Format Cleanup

- Clean the format of [Notion bibliography](../develop/resources/database.md).

## Module Expansion

- Expand the modules. For modules to be included later, see [notes on "key topics"](../develop/syllabus/topics/index.md).
- Include more research outside North American and Chinese contexts.
- Allow for multiple versions of the same module based on different rationale (e.g., level, focus, approach...).
- Include more multimedia resources.
- Turn the sections of "further reading" for each module into field-specific databases of literature.

## Syllabus Structure Adjustment

- Adjust the syllabus structure based on feedback.
