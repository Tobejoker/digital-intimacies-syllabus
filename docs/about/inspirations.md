## 1. Tiktok Syllabus

Output from TikTok Cultures Research Network (TCRN) at Curtin.

- In particular, the [TikTok Syllabus](https://tiktokcultures.com/syllabus2021/) by Dr. Abidin and Dr. Kaye and [Social Justice Syllabus](https://TikTokCultures.com/) by Dr. Abidin and Dr. Lee.
- Topic-based structure.
- Affordable workload. While I perceive syllabi by TCRN to be oriented toward independent study, my reading experiences suggest that a workload of four articles per week would be sufficient. Students will be motivated to expand their reading scope for building their own undergraduate teaching sample of their chosen areas. See [Assignment](../develop/syllabus/assignment/week15.md).
- Comprehensive materials. I also admire the syllabus for its strategic selections of materials with multiple versions for learners’ easier entrance.

## 2. Digital Intimacies Symposiums, 2015-2024

- I’m particularly grateful for Dr. Amy Dobson, as she provided the programs of Digital Intimacies #1, #2, and #4 missing online.

## 3. Digital Intimate Publics and Social Media

> A. S. Dobson, B. Robards, & N. Carah (Eds.), *Digital Intimate Publics and Social Media* (pp. 3–27). Springer International Publishing.

- See [project origin](origin.md).
- Can be seen as a comprehensive "summary" of the first 5 symposiums according to [Dr. Nicolas Carah's website](https://nicholascarah.com/digitalintimacies).

## 4. ["Digital Intimacies" Program](https://ccat.curtin.edu.au/programs/digital-intimacies/), Curtin

- Course description.

## 5. [Syllabi by Dr. Anastasia Todd](https://www.anastasiatoddphd.com/syllabi/)

- Format and level of difficulty. See [annotations on “Part II.”](../develop/syllabus/framework/index.md)

## 6. [Syllabus by B. E. Duffy]((https://static1.squarespace.com/static/58b37319ff7c508925e2d112/t/65b11916b4775c668f8cbb6e/1706105110950/Comm+7600-public-creator+economy+syllabus.pdf))

> Duffy, B. E. Platforms, Power, and Precarity in the Creator Economy: Spring 2024. Department of Communication, Cornell University.

- You can visit it from [Duffy's homepage](https://www.brookeduffy.com/).
- Format and level of difficulty. See annotations on ["Orienting Frameworks."](../develop/syllabus/framework/index.md)
- Time scope of the materials. It primarily includes texts within the recent 5 years. I do not find myself very successful at this direction, and aim to improve that with more literature review in the future.

## 7. Preliminary review of Journal article

Reviewing of publications on a list of journals using the keyword "digital intimacy" using the [InfoKat Discovery](https://saalck-uky.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/search?vid=01SAA_UKY:UKY) at the University of Kentucky, presumably supported by Ex Libris Group’s Primo discovery service.

- The list of journals include *Social Media + Society; New media & society; Media, culture & Society; Global Media and China; Feminist Media Studies; European journal of cultural studies; Continuum; Journal of Gender Studies; International Journal of Cultural Studies; Information, Communication & Society; Theory, Culture & Society*.
- The keyword approach also means that a lot others not containing the search terms were left out of the picture. However, it was worth it to look at the trend of pieces which felt the need to address their affiliations with these keywords. Overall, the results concur with trends spotted in the 10-year course of (2) Digital Intimacies Symposiums.

## 8. Encyclopedia entries

- See [Week 1](../develop/syllabus/basics/week1.md).

## 9. [2022 CUHK-KAU Digital Innovation Workshop](https://www.kau.se/genusvetenskap/utbildning/kurser-inom-genusvetenskap/international-summer-workshop-digital)

- A summer workshop I attended during master’s studies.

## 10. [Social Media + Society Volume 1](https://journals.sagepub.com/toc/smsa/1/1)

- A “manifesto” special issue that allows for a peak into how many envisioned social media studies was relevant to society in 2015.

## 11. [Critical Disinformation Studies: A Syllabus](https://citap.unc.edu/research/critical-disinfo/)

- This syllabus, authored by Alice Marwick, Rachel Kuo, Shanice Jones Cameron, and Moira Weigel, had a significant impact on the structure of the TikTok Syllabus. Unfortunately, I discovered this resource quite late, so the Digital Intimacies Syllabus 1.0 version did not contain many insights from it.
