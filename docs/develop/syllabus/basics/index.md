# What Counts as "Basics"?

Defining "digital intimacy" is complex. For more on why we focus on "digital intimacy," see "[Why 'Digital'? Why 'Intimacy'?](../../../about/whyname.md)."

The "Basics" section is arranged regressively. Students first encounter "digital intimacy" as a given concept, then explore how communication technology shapes its study, and finally delve into critical intimacy studies. This order prompts us to question how "the digital" reshapes our understanding of "the intimate."
