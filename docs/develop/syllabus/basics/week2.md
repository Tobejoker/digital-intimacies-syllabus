## Rationale

This course considers the students new to the fields of digital culture studies, platform studies, and communication studies in general. Therefore, this module is set to help students understand some of the threads that I deem essential for understanding common assumptions and analytical axes underlying later frameworks. These include how participation or consumer agency shapes the mediascape (Jenkins 2009), the "social" dimension of "social media" (Couldry & van Dijck 2015), and the concepts and applications of "platform society" (van Dijck 2018), "cultural industries" (Duffy et al. 2019), and "celebrity" (Crystal 2019).

The resulting selection reflects the heavy influence from the [TikTok Syllabus](../../../about/inspirations.md). The pedagogical takeaway is prioritizing digestibleness than influence, as in the selection of Jenkins's (2009) blog instead of the introduction of *Spreadable Media* (2013). The TikTok Syllabus's preference for special issue introductions also introduces them as the "where and how" to capture and analyze current academic trends, a technique crucial for my preliminary reviews of unfamiliar fields and conducive to building my reading list.
