## Rationale

This module functions as a cornerstone for entering the later modules, so I have kept it more up-to-date and in line with my word choice of "digital intimacy." The only (hopefully understandable) exception is Berlant's piece, primarily because it is referenced in almost every article using this framework and, as Rambukkana and Wang (2020) state, has shaped what we know as critical intimacy studies today. Therefore, I included it to provide more context for the students.

The other two pieces reflect more of my pedagogical considerations. As Wilson’s piece expands the transnational perspective of critical intimacy studies, Rambukkana’s writing offers an intriguing opportunity for graduate students to reflect on their positionalities as both students and future teachers of digital intimacies.
