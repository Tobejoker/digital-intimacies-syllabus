## Forthcoming Modules

Below is a list of the modules I have considered, along with the other "key topics". I ultimately decided not to include them in the final syllabus due to three factors: (1) their perceived lack of relevance to GWS, (2) the lack of advancements in digital studies, and (3) my lack of familiarity with them. I aim to develop these and other potential modules into a "database" of key topics in the future, serving as both a comprehensive bibliography and a resource hub for customizable syllabi.

- **Identity and subjectification**. Relevant discussions have appeared in the module ["Connection, Infrastructure, and Touch."](../framework/week4.md)
- **Race**. Relevant discussions have appeared in the module [Activism, Feminism, and Counterpubilcs](week9.md) and ["Toxic Technoculture."](week13.md)
- **Human-Computer Interaction**, intersecting with the module ["Connection, Infrastructure, and Touch."](../framework/week4.md)
- **Pornography**, intersecting with the module [“Sex Work.”](week12.md)
- **Labor**. Or, something obligated to do, forced to do, or denied to do.
- **Crisis**, in tandem with the exponential growth of scholarships in the Covid and post-Covid eras.
- **Disinformation**. Of particular popularity in the US context. Sources include ["Critical Disinformation Studies: A Syllabus."](../../../about/inspirations.md)
