## Rationale

As hinted earlier, this module represents one of the earliest and most dynamic areas of discussion regarding "digital intimacies." The established discussions facilitate comprehensive reviews that address the complexities of "intimacy," rather than merely categorizing behaviors as "romantic" or "sexual" (Robards & Lincoln, 2016; Dobson, 2018). Research on dating, sexting, and other mobile forms of intimacy reveals tensions between heteronormative and queer perspectives, as well as between connectivity and disconnectivity, similar to the considerations of "intimate relationships" in offline contexts (Chan, 2018; Vares, 2023).
