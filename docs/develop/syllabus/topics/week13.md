## Rationale

The chosen works center on discussions of important ideas in health, care, and welfare within the digital sphere. Many publications from journals in psychology, medicine, and sociology were under consideration, but finally none were chosen. This choice was taken to guarantee that students participate more actively in the critical debates and theoretical models supporting digital intimacies in health and welfare instead of concentrating on empirical results from these domains. The selected readings address subjects including privacy, care, access, networks of support, and maintenance and measurement of health. In the future, this module may include more findings on what it means to bring AI into health care.
