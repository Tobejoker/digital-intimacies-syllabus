## Rationale

This module primarily focuses on the US context, exploring online sex work as both an aspirational and precarious form of labor, along with its potential for pleasure. Continuing my efforts to push the boundary of the "digital" in the module ["Transformative Intimacy and Digital Worlding"](../framework/week7.md), this module includes explorations on pornography and documentaries of sex workers. In addition, Rodríguez's work prompts students to consider sex work from a wider perspective and explore various research approaches involving sex workers.
