## Rationale

Partly related to the focus on digital archives, topics of death, grief, and mourning have gained significant attention since the early explorations of digital intimacies (e.g., [Digital Intimacies symposium #1](../../../about/inspirations.md)). The selection draws heavily from the special issue ["Mediatization of Emotion on Social Media: Forms and Norms in Digital Mourning Practices"](https://journals.sagepub.com/toc/smsa/4/1) in *Social Media + Society*. The inclusion of Hjorth and Clumiskey as well as Todd's work further questions how we witness death online today and who is worth living in the digitally connected world.
