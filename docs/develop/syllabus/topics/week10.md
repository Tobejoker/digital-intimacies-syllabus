## Rationale

Is any topic about digital culture unrelated to the issue of archives? In this sense, this module serves as yet another methodology section and asks: Why do people build and maintain digital archives? As a result, this module's selection focuses on affect, memory, nostalgia, queer time and place, and social justice in archival studies. If we consider the question of "How do people utilize and modify digital archives," other possible directions could include keywords like "NSFW," "trigger warnings," and "content moderation."
