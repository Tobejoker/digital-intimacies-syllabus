## Rationale

While "affective network" seems like the iteration of "interpersonal and intimate relations," the emphasis on the affective dimension of networked communities anticipates researchers' early attention to the emerging forms and shifting landscapes of affects online, as in the programs of ["Digital Intimacies" symposiums](../../../about/inspirations.md). Both Papacharissi's monograph and Hills et al.'s edited volume are tempting choices for a book-based module in this regard, and they certainly guarantee fruitful discussions in their own merits. However, I eventually included Abidin's (2015) and Duffy's (2016) works in place of a "key topic" module on "labor" I had not include in the 1.0 version syllabus but felt was too crucial to leave out.
