Drawing from interdisciplinary perspectives, the course offers conceptual and analytical resources for examining how digital mediation influences our experiences of connection, emotion, and belonging by combining insights from media studies, critical intimacy studies, and platform studies. Throughout, we trace the evolution of scholarship on digital intimacies, focusing on the ways technologies shape, enable, and constrain diverse forms of intimate expressions and relationships. Analyzing varying forms of digital intimacy ranging from dating apps, fan communities, to digital archives, students will analyze how different axes of power and diversity, such as gender, sexuality, race, and geography, influence experiences of digital intimacy. Through collaborative discussion, students will explore central questions including: In what ways do digital technologies intersect with intimate relationships? What new forms of connection emerge through the digital? How does examining digital intimacies further our understanding of the texture of everyday lives?</p>","tags":["Syllabus"]},{"location":"about/documentation/","title":"How to Use This","text":"","tags":["Syllabus"]},{"location":"about/documentation/#digital-intimacies-syllabus-11","title":"Digital Intimacies Syllabus 1.1","text":"","tags":["Syllabus"]},{"location":"about/documentation/#basic-info","title":"Basic Info","text":"Category Info Draft Date December 19, 2024 Launch Date February 11, 2025 Contributor Norah Chow (University of Kentucky) Schedule 15 weeks (excluding 1-week break) Structure Linear","tags":["Syllabus"]},{"location":"about/documentation/#syllabyus-structure","title":"Syllabyus Structure","text":"Category Theme Basics 1.

It originated from an independent study titled \"Feminism, Social Media, Digital Cultures\" with Dr. Anastasia Todd in Fall 2024. Our shared interest in social media studies led us to explore the TikTok Syllabus as our primary reading list. Unlike Dr. Todd's focus on celebrity studies, I found myself drawn more to analyzing comment sections, owing to my background in fan studies and my positionality as what Henry Jenkins terms an \u201caca-fan\u201d (academic-fan).</p> <p>To be clear, fan studies wasn't my initial academic focus in higher education, but emerged gradually through my scholarly journey, which has shaped my approach to this project. Starting with undergraduate work in pre-20<sup>th</sup>-century Chinese sexuality culture, my research evolved through master's and doctoral studies to examine contemporary Chinese queer fan culture practices, particularly focusing on female audiences. Throughout this journey, I have contemplated how to articulate my research interests that transcend both historical periods and disciplinary boundaries beyond the labels of \"cultural studies\" and \"gender studies.\"</p> <p>A moment of revelation occurred during the ninth week of the semester when I titled my self-selected reading list for the fall break as \"intimacy.\" I remembered declaring to Anastasia in the meeting afterward how this concept crystallized not just my semester project but my broader research interests. During my master's study, my theoretical foundation, built on works by Haiyan Lee, Giddens, Yunxiang Yan, and Illouz, took on new dimensions when I discovered Berlant's perspective on intimacy. Her definition and vision had an extraordinarily liberating quality, capturing the subtle intricacies of queer fan culture that both transcends and retains traditional, existing, and hegemonic sex/gender systems. Discovering Dobson, Robards, and Carah's (2018) Digital Intimate Publics and Social Media during my first year of doctoral studies felt like coming home\u2014it helps bridge cultural specificities with global patterns, providing a clear direction for my research.</p> <p>I now have the confidence to say that, my research examines interpersonal intimacies in the digital age, encompassing various forms regardless of their sexual connotations, intensity, origins, or structures. While my primary focus is mainland China, with a gradual expansion to East Asia and the broader Asian context, I find myself in dialogue with scholars across historical, geographical, and disciplinary boundaries who share this concern. This cross-cultural perspective distinguishes the project, offering insights into how traditional concepts of intimacy evolve in digital spaces while identifying patterns that transcend cultural boundaries.</p> <p>The \u201cDigital Intimacy Syllabus\u201d thus emerges as a developing project that seeks resonance and collaboration. It serves both to document my evolving research and pedagogical journey, and to share these resources and reflections with fellow researchers. Acknowledging the inevitable limitations of such an endeavor\u2014the bibliography will always be incomplete, the pedagogical approaches always under scrutiny\u2014I earnestly invite readers' feedback, suggestions, and critiques to collectively enhance our understanding of digital intimacy across cultural contexts.</p>","tags":["Syllabus"]},{"location":"about/whatnext/","title":"Coming Next","text":"<p>Info</p> <p>Below is the to-do list for later versions of Digital Intimacies Syllabus.</p>","tags":["Syllabus"]},{"location":"about/whatnext/#format-cleanup","title":"Format Cleanup","text":"<ul> <li>Clean the format of Notion bibliography.</li> </ul>","tags":["Syllabus"]},{"location":"about/whatnext/#module-expansion","title":"Module Expansion","text":"<ul> <li>Expand the modules.

In its early sociological discussions played out in modern times (Giddens 1992), this word functions almost as the equivalent of \"sexuality.\" As Dobson and her colleagues (2018) reflect on the legacy of critical intimacy studies (e.g., Berlant, 1998; Illouz, 2007) and call for a feminist and queer-oriented approach, I saw the merits more in expanding our horizons than establishing a brand new field. A comparable example is the coining of \"queer theories\" as a vision to expand LGBT/Gay and Lesbian Studies, though they eventually collided in institutionalization. Similarly, the continuous project of \"digital intimacies\" in terms of both the edited volume and the decade-long symposiums (2015-present) offers an emancipating framework for us to move beyond the early discussions on sex/para-relationships on social media and understand the connective affect from and around us.</p> <p>That being said, as someone from Asia with a background in queer fandom studies, I feel both a sense of belonging and an urge to contribute my perspective to this expanding project. This effort will be particularly evident in my design for the module \"Transformative Intimacy and Digital Worlding,\" where I aim to draw inspiration from the conversations on Otaku culture, which are among the first to address media-based sexualities and networked communities.</p>","tags":["Syllabus"]},{"location":"about/whyname/#why-digital","title":"Why \u201cDigital\u201d?","text":"<p>Comparatively, I found this question more challenging than distinguishing between different types of \"intimacy.\" Platform-related discussions have been increasingly prevalent, which partially mirrors the growing platformization of our personal lives in reality. However, in line with previous projects, this project maintains the term \"digital\" to refer to specific forms of digital intimacy that are still relevant and significant in today's society. These include interactions between humans, AI, robots, and gadgets, which do not necessarily involve platforms or other digital products that are not connected to the internet.</p> <p>Juggling between the qualifiers \"digital\" and \"platformed\" also interpellates what aspect or characteristics of \"intimacy\" I put most emphasis on. While both qualifiers highlight the materiality and conditions, or in the context of platform studies, \"affordances,\" upon which intimacy takes place, the determiner \"platformed\" seems to further suggest an internet-born/based connectivity between humans. However, the ambiguity of \u201cthe digital\u201d allows for investigation into intimacy with \u201cthings\u201d we keep to ourselves, such as the videotape we watched that summer, the album we used to listen to on music player in high school,  or the digital pet we\u2019ve been caring for for over a year.</p> <p>Keywords like \"networked,\" \"internet,\" \"online,\" \"cyber,\" \"virtual,\" and \"mediated\" share similar thought processes, each addressing one or more aspects of intimacy. Overall, to me, \"digital\" more effectively conveys the time, the consciousness, and the subjectification of individuals and groups utilizing and influenced by the digital, thus more promising for a collaborative project across times, places, and disciplines.</p>","tags":["Syllabus"]},{"location":"blog/","title":"Blog","text":""},{"location":"develop/resources/database/","title":"Bibliography","text":"<ul> <li>Digital Intimacies Syllabus Bibliography (Notion database)</li> </ul>"},{"location":"develop/syllabus/assignment/","title":"Assignments","text":"","tags":["Syllabus","Assignment"]},{"location":"develop/syllabus/assignment/#class-facilitation-and-short-paper-20","title":"Class Facilitation and Short Paper (20%)","text":"<p>Class facilitation involves distilling complex texts for your peers, sharing your insights, formulating and posing critical questions, and managing the dynamics of the discussion.

Therefore, I included it to provide more context for the students.</p> <p>The other two pieces reflect more of my pedagogical considerations. As Wilson\u2019s piece expands the transnational perspective of critical intimacy studies, Rambukkana\u2019s writing offers an intriguing opportunity for graduate students to reflect on their positionalities as both students and future teachers of digital intimacies.</p>","tags":["Course","Basics"]},{"location":"develop/syllabus/framework/","title":"Why \"Framework\"?","text":"<p>I was vacillating between Dr. Duffy\u2019s (arranging specific modules for orienting frameworks) and Dr. Todd\u2019s (organizing modules under given frameworks) approaches. A 15-week schedule already seems too jammed for such a broad term as \u201cdigital intimacies,\u201d and taking much space to introduce the frameworks may become unproductive, or worse, unconvincing in itself. It was during this contemplating process that I recognized that my goal was more to join the conversation than to provide a \u201ccomprehensive\u201d review.</p> <p>The resulting framing choices could be highly debatable, as they do not come from any pre-established reviews I know of. Rather, they stem from my inductive reading of the 10-year trajectory of \u201cDigital Intimacies\u201d symposiums and a selective sampling of journal articles (Inspirations and references for syllabus building). In terms of both scholarly and pedagogical developments, I found this exercise to be fruitful as it motivated me to always view research from distinct areas in a broader and connecting context, relating it to the digital and intimate.</p> <p>Every module in this section combines abstract \"conceptual\" pieces with works that function as \"applications\" within this framework and serve as valuable starting points for a particular field. By using this selection criteria, I aim to map a constellation of scholarship that could enhance our comprehension of \"digital intimacies.\"</p> <p>In hindsight, this approach could potentially lead to a lack of dialogue between the readings within the same module, as I may have occasionally sacrificed contexts in favor of perspectives. The students may also be confused due to the nonlinear arrangement of materials, as they will find inconsistent links between works from the \u201cOrienting Frameworks\u201d section and the \u201cKey Topics\u201d in terms of fields. However, I hope this section will also assist students in framing their undergraduate teaching examples for the final assignment.</p> <p>The undergraduate version, when available, employs alternative names, with a less prominent emphasis on the \"orienting frameworks\" approach.
